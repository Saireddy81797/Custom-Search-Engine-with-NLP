Custom Search Engine with NLP (Hybrid Recommender System)

A scalable recommendation engine built using Python, NLP, and Scikit-learn.
It combines content-based filtering (using TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity) and collaborative filtering (user-item matrix) to deliver personalized product recommendations for e-commerce scenarios.

🚀 Key Highlights

Content-based filtering → Analyzes product titles, descriptions, and categories.

Collaborative filtering → Learns from user behavior and ratings.

Hybrid approach → Merges both techniques for improved personalization.

Scalable pipeline → Modular design for easy extension to real-world datasets.
